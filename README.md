# Highlight Reel Video 

### Hello!! Welcome to the Highlight Reel Video Project. This Project is about creating an highlight reel that will be a short but an informative video of the larger video that includes all the important moments fromthe main video with preprocessing and feature engineering. It utilizes a combination of trajectory analysis, machine learning classification, and video processing to generate engaging highlights from match footage. This system streamlines the workflow for analysts, coaches, and content creators by automating event detection and video production.

Animate ball trajectories using animation.py.
2. **Model Training and Prediction:** Train a classification model using Time_Classification1.py.
Visualize model predictions with visualize_target.py.
3. **Prediction Smoothing:** Smooth raw predictions using techniques like moving averages, Gaussian filters, and expansion (handled in filter_predictions.py).
4. **Highlight Generation:** Generate highlights from smoothed predictions, with seamless transitions applied to key events (video_transition.py).
5. **Final Output and Evaluation:** Save results and visualize comparisons between raw, smoothed predictions, and ground truth data.

- *Feature-Rich Analysis:* Extract meaningful features such as distance travelled, angle change.
- *Advanced Smoothing:* Techniques like median, Gaussian, and moving average filters ensure stable event detection.
- *Highlight Transitions:* High-quality transitions, including fade, slide, and dissolve effects, for professional output.

## Results

1. **Feature**:
   - Distance Travelled: Tells how much distance the ball hav covered with respect to time.
   - Angle Change: The angle change feature measures the change in direction between consecutive points. It can help analyze motion dynamics, such as:Identifying turns or changes in trajectory, understanding directional patterns in movement, detecting anomalies or irregularities in motion paths.

4. **Highlight Video:**
   - Highlights with smooth transitions are saved. Transition effects like fade, slide, and dissolve enhance the presentation quality of the video.

5. **Video Transition Details**
   - The video transitions were visually appealing, adding a professional touch to the highlight reel.
   - Transitions: Transitions between highlights are generated using OpenCV.
   - Fade: Gradual blending of two frames to create a smooth effect.
   - Slide: Left-to-right or right-to-left frame transitions for a dynamic effect.
   - Dissolve: Pixel-level blending based on randomized masking to create a seamless transition.
